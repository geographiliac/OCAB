## Data and GIS files for Buffalo Reapportionment (Our City Action Buffalo)

Read more about [redistricting within Buffalo here](https://www.ourcityactionbuffalo.com/redistricting), and specifically the plan to empower Buffalo residents [through equitable maps here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vToZUMju9unyIPePZVceVNINPkQf7aphpGFStjaNg_JV55Zzgf6cBkD89CesEyfPuQ_tj0ilOpuD8cs/pub).

The City of Buffalo's common council has posted their [plan for reapportionment here (boo)](https://www.buffalony.gov/1505/Reapportionment). 
However, their maps have only been released as a .pdf, which makes the maps inaccessable to independent inquiry or analysis. This pdf was painstakenly digitized by Rusty Weaver [(@RustBeltgGeo)](https://twitter.com/RustBeltGeo), who also created the maps and analytics above. 

To date, the Buffalo common council, and the reapportionment commission, has not released GIS files for their proposed map or even statistics about the compactness of the districts they selected.
