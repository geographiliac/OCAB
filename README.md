## Data and GIS files for Buffalo Reapportionment (Our City Action Buffalo)

Read more about [redistricting within Buffalo here](https://www.ourcityactionbuffalo.com/redistricting), and specifically the plan to empower Buffalo residents [through equitable maps here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vToZUMju9unyIPePZVceVNINPkQf7aphpGFStjaNg_JV55Zzgf6cBkD89CesEyfPuQ_tj0ilOpuD8cs/pub).

The City of Buffalo's common council has posted their [plan for reapportionment here (boo)](https://www.buffalony.gov/1505/Reapportionment). 
However, their maps have only been released as a .pdf, which makes the maps inaccessable to independent inquiry or analysis. This pdf was painstakenly digitized by Rusty Weaver [(@RustBeltgGeo)](https://twitter.com/RustBeltGeo), who also created the maps and analytics above. 

To date, the Buffalo common council and the reapportionment commission have not released the GIS files for their proposed map. The [Buffalo Open Data portal](https://data.buffalony.gov/Government/Council-Districts/u5mx-ugvy) does include the current council districts established in 2011 (also stored in this repository).
